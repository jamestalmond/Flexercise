# Flexercise

## Setup

1. Install the project with `npm i` or `yarn`
1. Spin up the project with `npm run dev`

## Exercise

Build a simple 3 column layout, similar to the new [computing cat page](http://beta-aol/qa/computing).

The layout __must__:

1. Be made with flexbox
1. Be made with rows, not columns
1. Have more than 1 row

If you’re feeling brave, create a 2 column layout below the 3 column layout.

Get knee deep in flex and see what problems you come up against, remember to refer to the properties within the workshop document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pgKD1npgkk5iwy1QOLV2X-Lvk2DlsRKHIGS-5rTkiEQ/edit?usp=sharing) if you get stuck.

If you complete the first exercise, feel free to move onto the second exercise to recreate Fabio’s grid on AO business [here](http://www.ao-business.com/).
